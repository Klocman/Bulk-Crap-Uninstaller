/*
 * DropSink.cs - Add drop sink ability to an ObjectListView
 *
 * Author: Phillip Piper
 * Date: 2009-03-17 5:15 PM
 *
 * Change log:
 * v2.9
 * 2015-07-08   JPP  - Added SimpleDropSink.EnableFeedback to allow all the pretty and helpful
 *                     user feedback during drags to be turned off
 * v2.7
 * 2011-04-20   JPP  - Rewrote how ModelDropEventArgs.RefreshObjects() works on TreeListViews
 * v2.4.1
 * 2010-08-24   JPP  - Moved AcceptExternal property up to SimpleDragSource.
 * v2.3
 * 2009-09-01   JPP  - Correctly handle case where RefreshObjects() is called for
 *                     objects that were children but are now roots.
 * 2009-08-27   JPP  - Added ModelDropEventArgs.RefreshObjects() to simplify updating after
 *                     a drag-drop operation
 * 2009-08-19   JPP  - Changed to use OlvHitTest()
 * v2.2.1
 * 2007-07-06   JPP  - Added StandardDropActionFromKeys property to OlvDropEventArgs
 * v2.2
 * 2009-05-17   JPP  - Added a Handled flag to OlvDropEventArgs
 *                   - Tweaked the appearance of the drop-on-background feedback
 * 2009-04-15   JPP  - Separated DragDrop.cs into DropSink.cs
 * 2009-03-17   JPP  - Initial version
