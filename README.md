# Bulk Crap Uninstaller
Bulk Crap Uninstaller (or BCUninstaller) is a free (as in speech) program uninstaller. It excels at removing large amounts of applications with minimal user input. It can clean up leftovers, detect orphaned applications, run uninstallers according to premade lists, and much more! Even though BCU was made with IT pros in mind, it can be used by anyone with a basic understanding of how applications are installed/uninstalled in Windows.

BCU is fully compatible with Windows Store Apps, Steam, Windows Features and has special support for many uninstalling systems (NSIS, InnoSetup, Msiexec, and many other). Check below for a full list of functions.

Bulk Crap Uninstaller is licensed under Apache 2.0 open source license, and can be used in both private and commercial settings for free and with no obligations, as long as no conditions of the license are broken.

[Visit the official homepage](https://www.bcuninstaller.com/) to see the full list of quirks and features!

[Read the online documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller/blob/master/doc/BCU_manual.html) if you have any questions or issues (the help file included with all releases). If you didn't find an answer to your question, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller/issues/new).

## Download
You can get the latest version from the releases page. Alternatively you can download it from one of these hosts:
- [Download from dAppCDN](https://dappcdn.com/download/utilities/bulk-crap-uninstaller)
- [Download from FossHub](https://www.fosshub.com/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller.html)
- [Download from SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bulk-crap-uninstaller/)

#### What are the different variants?
- Setup - Installs BCU as a normal application. If your system is missing the required .NET runtime, it is automatically installed as well.
- Portable - Self-contained version that does not require the .NET runtime to run. It includes a runtime which is why the file size is so large.
- net - Stand-alone portable version that requires the .NET runtime to be installed. Much smaller file size than the full Portable version.

#### Nightly builds
If you want to get the latest features and fixes as soon as they are available, you can download a nightly build from the [actions page](https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller/actions/workflows/ci.yaml).

## System requirements
#### BCUninstaller v6
- Earliest supported OS: Windows 10 (with most system updates installed)
- Requirements: .NET 8 desktop runtime (not needed for portable)

To get this version download the latest release from the links below.

_*Note: Since none of the supported systems have x86 versions, v6 releases no longer include an x86 build. If you need one you can still compile it yourself, or you can use the AnyCPU build instead._

#### BCUninstaller v5
- Earliest supported OS: Windows 7 SP1 with all Platform Updates (KB2670838, KB2533623, etc.)
- Requirements: .NET 6 desktop runtime (not needed for portable)

If you get a DLL error on startup then try running Windows Update. If you get a framework error, install .NET6 either manually or through Windows Update.

To get this version download the [latest available 5.x release](https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller/releases/tag/v5.9).

_*Note: The Portable version does not require the .NET6 runtime to be installed, since it is included (that's why the portable version is so large)._

#### BCUninstaller v1 - v4
- Earliest supported OS: Windows XP (XP support may be dodgy in later releases)
- Requirements: .Net Framework 4.5 (some versions can run on .Net Framework 3.5 with reduced functionality)

Make sure you have .Net Framework 4.5 installed with all available updates for your system (it is not installed on XP by default).

To get this version compile the [legacy 4.x branch](https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller/tree/legacy-4.x) or download the [latest available 4.x release](https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller/releases/tag/v4.16).

## How can I help?
Please check the [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) notes!

## Compiling
Development is done on Visual Studio 2022. The solution should just load and build without doing anything extra, provided necessary VS features are installed.
The installer is compiled with InnoSetup v6.4. To make a release you have to first run the `publish.bat` script.
